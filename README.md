**📋 Project Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict residential property prices using the Ames Iowa Housing dataset. By analyzing 79 different features of 1,460 homes, I developed and compared multiple predictive models to identify key price drivers and provide accurate property valuations.
Key Highlights:

✅ Best Model Performance: XGBoost achieved R² = 0.892 with RMSE of $14,171
✅ Comprehensive Analysis: Explored 79 features including quality ratings, square footage, and location
✅ Actionable Insights: Identified top 3 price drivers: Overall Quality, Total Square Footage, and Living Area
✅ Business Value: 31% improvement in prediction accuracy over baseline linear regression
