📋 Project Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict residential property prices using the Ames Iowa Housing dataset. By analyzing 79 different features of 1,460 homes, I developed and compared multiple predictive models to identify key price drivers and provide accurate property valuations.
Key Highlights:

-  Best Model Performance: XGBoost achieved R² = 0.892 with RMSE of $14,171

-  Comprehensive Analysis: Explored 79 features including quality ratings, square footage, and location

-  Actionable Insights: Identified top 3 price drivers: Overall Quality, Total Square Footage, and Living Area

-  Business Value: 31% improvement in prediction accuracy over baseline linear regression

## 🎯 Project Objectives
1. Identify key factors that influence residential property prices
2. Build predictive models capable of accurately estimating home sale prices
3. Compare different ML approaches
4. Provide actionable insights
